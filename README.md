[![Material Life is on Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.juankysoriano.materiallife)

Building is easy, just do `./gradlew clean life` and it will build the apk, execute the unit tests and run a few code analysis tools.

You are free to open Pull Requests, actually you are more than welcome to do it!
