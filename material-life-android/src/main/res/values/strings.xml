  <string name="game_of_life_description">The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
    \n\nIt is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.</string>

  <string name="rules_explanation">1.\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
    \n\n2.\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    \n\n3.\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
    \n\n4.\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
